# [Portfolio](https://jaredhennessy.github.io/)

My portfolio site uses the Bulma framework to ensure a responsibe, mobile-friendly layout with a clean design. Bulma tiles make the index page work, columns + cards handle the portfolio, and the contact info is in a box with an embedded LinkedIn badge. I'm also using jquery to make the navbar hamburger work on narrower screens as well as moment.js to calculate how long I've lived in Seattle, because I'm starting to forget. Font Awesome and Google Fonts spice things up a bit more.
